## Greedy Graph Coloring in Python

This Python code implements a greedy algorithm for graph coloring and visualizes the results using NetworkX.

### Features:

  - Greedy coloring algorithm to assign colors to graph vertices.
  - Function to validate if the assigned coloring is valid (no adjacent nodes share the same color).
  - Generates a random graph with a specified number of nodes and edge probability.
  - Prints the coloring result, number of colors used (K), and validates the coloring.
  - Visualizes the colored graph using NetworkX.

### Result with 30 nodes

### Instructions:

  - Run the code.
  - The code will print the coloring result, number of colors used, and validation check.
  - A plot of the colored graph will be displayed.

### Dependencies:

  - networkx
  - matplotlib.pyplot

### Notes:

  - The greedy algorithm does not guarantee the minimum number of colors.
